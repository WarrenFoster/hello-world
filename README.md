# hello-world
Just getting started in website design, Adv-Beginner

Wow so the more I look at github I realize how little I know, I guess im just trying to figure out where to start.

I want to do a month by month learning process of learning a new way to make websites every month. That way I end up knowing how to use many different tools for the year. Am looking for teachers and advice and overall friends. Open to suggestions.
